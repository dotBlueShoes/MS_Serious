Issue1:
 "PR Luminance" (standard) removes hardcore darkness mod effect.
 "PR Luminance" (full) gives complete darkness that can be lighten up using ingame brightness setting.
 "PR Luminance" increases the dark of shadows creating weird visible black circular under trees and blocky shadow under trees on water.
 "PR Luminance" increases the shadow of water-land edge making it weirdly outplaced. 

Solution:
 "PR Luminance" - will get replaced by my mod. "HardcoreDarkness" will prob. conflict too therefore it will also be removed. The mod i will create will contain the "HardcoreDarkness" features and "PR Luminance" orange light and different light levels in different dimensions.


Issue2:
 "Rainy Day" rain sounds are somewhat buggy. and drasticly change thair volume when changing look from forward to up the sky.

Solution:
 Create Own custom weather skin "BlendAlpha" to cover the art style of "Rainy Day" however for at least now don't touch the weather sounds.

Issue3 - Solution:
 "Sky_Water Demo" see if my implementation is gonna work on the "alpha biome", BOP biomes.

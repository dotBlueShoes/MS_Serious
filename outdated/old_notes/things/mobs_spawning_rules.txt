What if player would leave an invisible track that mobs would folow.

So lets say that mobs no longer spwan due to light
however a mob spwans near player if he sleeps in dark.

from now on mobs spawn only at night beyond a specific radius on surface.
and in areas unseen for player underground.

whats more player now leaves a track from which mobs will come in.
this track will act as a loaded chuck from which mobs will spawn with the set
goal of killing the player.
If there were 2 players at the same chunk the one that visited it last will be bothered.
track has a time stemp. so so

// actually
i might just keep the position of the player on the world
and track his avarge position relative to it's current position.
and based on that spawn mobs somewhere from that/those directions.
- this would have no time stemps and will collect information during day
and aplay it at night.

Additional Sieges.
Certain nights might bring sieges.
 - undeed
 - spider
 - creeper

Siege has no informer of it happening.
You will know u're under the sidge when u'll see all the monsters
around your base.
- but i do think that when siedge is happening a new kind of a monster ar an abillity
should exist.
(ignited zombie) - burning things having a low lifespan.
(big spider) - a big spider.
(balistic creeper) - tnt'ing his way through when he sees you. (prob. will die from his own expl.)


And as we're talking about night i think that only and during nights there should be a chance for a meteor shower that mght end up with a meteor hitting the ground somewhere.

also moon phase specific mob abillities. i guess a specific siege might be assigned to a specifc moon phase.

and of corse sieges and night enemy spawning will combine and it will be even more dangerous.

i would also love to see a light emitting mob.

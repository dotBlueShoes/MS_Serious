- First thing he should do is look for food and wood
- after he collected enaugh to make a wooden pickaxe and workbench
he should dig for stone. occasionlly user might find bronze on the surface level
allowing him to create better tools/armour then stone.
(silent gear - bronze)
(removing coal and iron from surface level)
After gaining stone/bronze user shoud cut down more trees prob. a lot of them due to the no coal on surface level.
He shoud make charlcoal instead burning wood with wood.

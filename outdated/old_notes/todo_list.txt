- Living stone 
a stone variant that is animated it appear blurry and it slowly moves
living stone will grow as goo would. if mined it will regrow.
can be lit of fire to fastly remove a massive chunk of it.


# InGame Test
- Look out for papercraft. How hard is it to craft thoose blocks? Are all of these blocks wanted? Are there any console errors due to this mod?

- Make it so ores always drop when exploded via tnt.
- remove flowers all of them bring back original yellow and red flower.
- think about new ways of getting dye.

- diffrensiate overwolrd lava from deepcave lava attributes. (energy and such)

- An alpha like biome as an mainly genereting biome 
(might be achived via modds)
(might be achived via texturepack)

- 3-8 custom small structures gennereting on surface it's a collection of chisel cobblestone/stone variants, water, lava and oil.

- make it that whenever a chisel block is being mined without silk touch it's returning to it's original block + when stone variant is being mined it's giving cobblestone instead.

- Road Runner, Ido, Better Placement, FreeLook, Squake
 - make biomes more alpha like (orchind, highland)
 - scray monster instead of enderman
 - test shaders (BSL Shaders) [rivers]
 - forestry ores config (common.cfg)
 - ic2 ores config
 - buildcraft ores config (seems like only all can be disabled)
 - forestry - remove trees that are duplicate (it has a config)
- ogarnij co by wypad³o z buildcrafta jakby by³a tylko opcja (nie generuj)

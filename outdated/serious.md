# Serious Modpack

## About

Serious is a *"minecraft"* modpack that tries to be more polished and somewhat different from others. Well the goal gameplay of this modpack should look somewhat close to terracraft :smile:. However it is the best for the player not to think about this game as of any minecraft addon it's more of a new game build around some of the minecraft fundamentals.

### Some Facts

* There will never be an item stronger then diamond.
* There will be no enchantments.
* There will be no shields.
* There can be only potions that doesn't apply any pvp or pve improvements.
* The game is supposed to be scary and it's my goal to keep that feel to the end.
* There will be creepier enemies and more dungerous.
* As theres got to be danger there also is safety.
* And there will be danger even tho the player is in the *diamond tier* armors.
* The player will be able to make impressive defensive tactics  that would leave to somewhat  safety feel. 

### New Ores

Copper, Tin, Bronze and these only extend current minecraft progression. They're not stronger then  diamond. and their main use are mashines alongside Iron and Silicone (redstone).

### UI Overhaul

Complete UI redesign, that not only makes minecraft feel a new, but also introduces old minecraft one hand with an extra. Also a compability with new storaging system that introduces backpacks and more. the UI will also show more information like the current amount of all the arrows player is holding.

### Feel Different 

- The Nether is Gone (it got a replacement)
- The Potions are Gone (those might return at sometime with a different purpose)
- the creation of leather will be mush simplified as way more of mobs give leather.
- there might be potion favoured food.
- i might overhaul hunger system. replace hunger with energy.
- i might be creating other kinds of bows.
- and there will be special bags to hold arrows in so it would be easier to manage them.
- will reduce the getting of discs to only via creeper-skeleton interaction.
- create new drops that will be achived via similar interactions.

### Waves Of Eniemies

* The pathfinding is about to get way simplified
* But the overall amount of enemies is about to change.
* there will be more creepers simply to mimic the original concept of camuflage creepers.
* baby zombies will be deleted.
* there will be monsters that spawn with swords, fishing rods, bows.
* Arrows overhaul. Instead of potion effect + basic arrow i am introducing about 4 new kinds of arrows (bone arrow, iron arrow, bronze arrow, gold arrow)

### Nights

To make adventuring during nights harder and more interesting i will  reduce the generation of friendly creatures to 0 and to make nights special i want weird new things happening like blue moon. Maybe add some block infection during nights.

### Lights

I will introduce more lightning to the game and make enemies immune to the light. The monsters from now on will also spawn near player if he attempts to sleep in dark just like in alpha. 

## Game Mechanics



## Game World

World with its look should present as somewhat close to *minecraft alpha state* with few additions. Like the appearance of  more majestic biomes. Those will be somewhat if not exactly bop biomes. The World is full of chemical ingredients that we as a player can interact with. Now there are some features that were seen in other mods yet this modpack will introduce much more.

* Alpha fogginess
* Alpha beaches
* Alpha crazy terrain
* Alpha colors
* BOP biomes
* Lava variants (stone kinds and melted forms of ores)
* Water variants (hypoxic waters[no oxygen], anoxic waters[low oxygen])
* Silicon in place of redstone
* About 2-3 gem like ore (diamond, emerald)

## Changes To Drops

* Chopping trees now gives *wood logs* and sawdust. To get the wood as a block we need to craft a petrified wood out of it.
* Zombies now have a chance to drop a single feather *to bow the old times*.
* Animals: 
  * Sheep
    * Killing gives up to (1) wool block.
    * Sheering gives about (3-4) woold blocks
  * Pig
  * Chicken
  * Cow
  * Mooshroom Cow
  * Wolf
  * Deers
  * Tirkeys
  * Snails
  * Butterflies
  * Dragonflies
  * Pixies

# ModPack Development

This is a quick tutorial that works as my reminder and maybe a helper for you. When creating a modpack and possibly sharing it or even publicating it via CurseForge it's good to know what and where things have to be and where they don't need to be.

## Unsorted Quick Writing Bullshit

- Files that are being pulled from curseforge are specified in manifest.json file.
- Resourcepacks too.
- To make a resourcepack picked at start we need to specify the texturepack.zip in the options.txt file.
- ? Do other files from override make it or does it only override ?
- U don't need to have a resourcepack to change textures it can be done via "resources" in override folder. This is cool for me because there are definitly things that i want in seriuos textures that i don't want in BlendAlpha
- U can implement mods that are not in curseforge by folder "mods" in override
